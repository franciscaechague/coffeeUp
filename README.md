# Coffee-Up

Innovative responsive app that helps you decide what coffee to have and where to have it! It's not easy to decide between 25 different coffees and less when you don't know what each coffee has

## Description

Using different technologies, I developed an app where you answer quesitons in order to know what coffee you're in the mood for. I used Wikipedia's API to get the description of each coffee. Once you know which coffee you're going to have, you can see which coffee shops are near you and get directions thanks to Google Maps API. Using a firebase, I recolected all the information of chosen coffees to make future recommendations of most chosen coffees.
